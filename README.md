## Overview

about me page - this page is an introductory page and also serves as the homepage of the website. This page utilizes Bootstrap's grid system, in addition to some of the Bootstrap elements.

contact page - the contact page has input fields for a user to enter their name, email, and a message. There is also a submit button. This contact form currently does not work yet, but will be connected to a database in the future.

portfolio page - the portfolio page is designed to showcase snippets of specific projects. There are currently placeholder images, however the goal is to add to this as projects are finished.

This website is responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes. Twitter Bootstrap's grid system was utilized to setup each page. You will also notice that the footer is sticky for every screen size.
